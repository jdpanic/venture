Venture Readme:

Venture is a simple adventure-game engine written in Python using the Django framework. It is designed to accomodate multiple players who cooperate or play solo interacting with NPCs, items and rooms/environments.

Installation instructions:
- Download and install Django 1.3 from the website (djangoproject.com) or through pip (sudo pip install django)
- Add "venture" to the installed_apps tuple in your project's settings.py file. Also uncomment the line which adds the admin app.
- Set up your database, also in settings.py
- Add syncdb 
- Add venture.urls to your project urlconf. This is the urlpatterns tuple in your urls.py file. The line should look like:
from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, include, url

urlpatterns = pattern(
    # ...
    url(r'^', include('venture.urls')),
    # ...
)

TODO:
- Get quests working
- Person._checkquests and Person.take(item) both return potentially giant concatinated strings. Maybe move this to the view or template layer.
